## Who Am I
I am a disciple of Jesus Christ. I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Arizona State University.
I am fluent in Spanish, having learned the language by spending 2 years in southern Chile as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

## My Interest in Programming
Growing up, I enjoyed being around computers, and seeing what they can do.

I also found an interest in Google Sheets and created spreadsheets to track my finances, car maintenance and other small fun projects. As I began to push the limits of Google Sheets I began to look into programming and what I could do with it.
